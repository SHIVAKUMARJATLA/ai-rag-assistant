## Dataset Source

Academic regulation documents were collected from the official
BVRIT academic regulations webpage, which links to Google Drive–
hosted PDF documents. These PDFs were downloaded, converted to text,
and cleaned to build a domain-specific knowledge base for the RAG system.


## Data Handling

Raw academic regulation PDFs are sourced from the official
college website and Google Drive links. Due to file size and
licensing, raw PDFs are not committed to the repository.
Preprocessing scripts are provided to reproduce the dataset.
